# ICTGame
A game I made back in Year 9 (2017). It's not really a "game" per se, but more about remembering numbers; hence the name "Numbers!". It's written entirely in VB.Net (if a little sloppy). For copyright reasons, all images have been omitted (but you can easily add them back by finding some new ones).
